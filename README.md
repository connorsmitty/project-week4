For this assignment we were tasked with creating a timed quiz using javascript. For this assignment I faced many difficulties and struggled a fair amount.

When tasked with these modules I have much difficulty understanding where to start and also what specifically it is that I need to do in order to even start the assignment. 

However I know that not everything is functioning properly,  I will give it more debugging during break and will turn in for a better result.

I watched various YouTube videos on how to write a timed quiz using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One of the ones that I found which helped me greatly was by CodingNepal, who gives a full YouTube tutorial on how to structure and write one properly.
